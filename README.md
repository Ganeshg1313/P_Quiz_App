# P_Quiz_App

This is a simple quiz app.
<br>

##While making the App I have learned following things : 
<br>

1 => Use of .btn:hover:not([disabled])<br>
2 => How to use Object and the Object destructuring<br>
3 => DOM Manipulation<br>
4 => How to create Responsive design<br>

<br>

##Working :
<br>

1 => When user visits the website he will be able to see the first question and the options.<br>

2 => When user will click on any option the next button will be become visible.<br>

3 => If the answer is correct then the background color of the select option will become green and of the answer is wrong the bg color of the selected option will become red and the correct answer's bg color will automatically change to green.<br>

4 => At last the user will get the final score and can play again.<br>
